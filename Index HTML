    <h2>üí≥ Financial Fraud Detection (BSAN 726)</h2>
    <p>In this project, my team and I built a database and ran SQL queries to uncover patterns in financial fraud. We looked at things like high-risk merchants, suspicious times of day, and customer behavior. To make the insights easier to understand, we used Power BI to build a dashboard. It was a great way to apply analytics to a real-world problem and show how data can help catch fraud before it happens.</p>

    <h2>üç∑ Wine Quality Classification (BSAN 750)</h2>
    <p>In this project, we analyzed a wine quality dataset using R to find out which factors influence wine ratings. We performed data cleaning, visualized key relationships, and used logistic regression to classify wines as high or low quality. It was a great way to apply R for real-world data analysis and modeling.</p>
