    <h3>üí≥ Financial Fraud Detection (BSAN 726)</h3>
    <p>In this project, my team and I built a database and ran SQL queries to uncover patterns in financial fraud. We looked at things like high-risk merchants, suspicious times of day, and customer behavior. It was a great way to apply analytics to a real-world problem and show how data can help catch fraud before it happens.</p>

    <h3>üç∑ Wine Quality Classification (BSAN 750)</h3>
    <p>In this project, we analyzed a wine quality dataset using R to find out which factors influence wine ratings. We performed data cleaning, visualized key relationships, and used logistic regression to classify wines as high or low quality. It was a great way to apply R for real-world data analysis and modeling.</p>

    <h3>üìä Power BI Performance Dashboard</h3>
    <p>During my internship, I designed an interactive performance dashboard in Power BI to help track key metrics across departments. The dashboard allowed leadership to monitor progress against targets, spot performance gaps, and quickly identify areas needing attention. It gave the team a clear, real-time view of operations and helped support more data-informed decisions.</p>

    <h3>üìà Tableau Metrics Dashboard</h3>
    <p>I built this Tableau dashboard for my team to track key metrics in one place. It visualized performance trends over time and helped us quickly identify areas that needed attention. The goal was to make insights accessible and actionable without needing to dig through raw data ‚Äî and it worked.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>üìÖ Weekly Update Dashboard</h3>
    <p>I created this weekly update dashboard to replace a dense, hard-to-read Excel file that my team had been using. The dashboard made the data easier to digest, helped us track key updates more efficiently, and was eventually adopted as a model for other consulting teams to use for their client insights. It streamlined reporting and saved hours of manual effort each week.</p>
